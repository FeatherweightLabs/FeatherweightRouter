/**

 The Router is a structure that collects functions together that are related to the same routing
 unit.

 Each Router also requires a RouterDelegate, through which any required changes are passed to.

 The generic type <T> - most likely a ViewController - is the item to be presented if this route
 is evaluated and determined to be a match to the current route.

 The current route path is set via a String. Paths are expected to be normalised before being
 passed to the Router, in so much as any string passed in - if valid - should be in a state that is
 able to match the appropriate route selector.

 Ie, hostname and protocol stripped, and string down-cased if required.
