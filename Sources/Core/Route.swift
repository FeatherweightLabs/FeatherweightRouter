 Route: Constructed with patten, view creator and an array of child routes.

 Route is used to check it matches a path. It only matches a path if it and possibly combined with
 it's children, matches a path from beginning to end. Ie, for Route(pattern) == / != Path:
 Route("home") matches(==) Path("/home/")
 "home" == "/home/"
 "home" != "/home/no-match/"
 "home[page1,page2]" == "home"
 "home[page1,page2]" == "home/page1"
 "home[page1,page2]" == "/home/page1/"
 */

    public init(_ pattern: String, _ creator: SegmentViewCreator, _ children: [Route] = []) {

        segmentViewCreator = creator
        self.children = children
    }
